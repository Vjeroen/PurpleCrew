```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vjeroen/PurpleCrew.git
cd PurpleCrew
```

2. **Install UV (if not already installed)**

```bash
pip install uv
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or if using CrewAI directly:

```bash
crewai install
```

4. **Set up Environment Variables**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

Start the agents using within the purple crew folder:


Running FAST API  server on port 8000

```bash
uvicorn crew-api:app --reload
```
Running crewai locally via terminal:

```bash
crewai flow run
```

Posting a report and question to the purplecrew:
1. Start CrewAI with the uvicorn command 
2. Open up the index.html file to test and submit certain TI reports.

## üõ≤Ô∏è Future Roadmap

- **More Modular Crew Design**  
  Introduce additional modular crews, agents and state flow sharing to optimize task execution pathways and allow highly dynamic, composable missions.

- **Efficient Foreach Execution**  
  Implement enhanced handling of concurrent or sequential task runs using optimized `foreach_kickoff()` patterns.

- **Enhanced Task Descriptions**  
  Fine-tune and expand task instructions, improving agent behavior fidelity and action clarity.

- **Advanced State Sharing**  
  Leverage `self.state.<models>` for better state tracking between agents, ensuring smoother multi-agent cooperation and memory sharing.

- **Tool Expansion**  
  Incorporate additional cybersecurity, operations, and infrastructure tools into the agents' toolboxes. 

- **Cloud Expansion**  
  The curren PoC is build on top of Azure and sysmon logging forwarded to Sentinel SIEM, in the near future support will be added for other cloud environments and detection technology.  

- **UI/UX Improvements**  
  Extend or refine the simple front-end API Calls  for better visualization of tasks, crew states, and operational reports.

- **Extend Documentation**  
  Create a fully documented project viea, including dependencies, lessons learned and how to adopt.
