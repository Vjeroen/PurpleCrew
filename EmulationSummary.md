This report reviews the techniques utilized, clearly outlining their operational flow and associated indicators of compromise.

## Target and Victim Information
Aqua Blizzard has primarily targeted governmental and key organizational sectors, specifically focusing on entities resembling Ukrainian government officials, which they impersonate in their phishing campaigns. 

## Attack Flow and MITRE ATT&CK Techniques
The Aqua Blizzard attack flow includes the following techniques:

1. **T1583.001 - Acquire Infrastructure: Domains**
   - Description: Adversaries may acquire domains that can be used during targeting.
   - Use: Utilized for impersonating legitimate entities.

2. **T1566.001 - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment**
   - Description: The adversary sends spearphishing emails with malicious attachments.
   - Use: These emails often contain vectors such as malicious macros embedded in documents.

3. **T1204.002 - User Execution: Malicious File**
   - Description: Users are social engineered to open malicious files.
   - Use: This technique allows malicious code execution when the document is opened.

4. **T1036 - Masquerading**
   - Description: Aqua Blizzard manipulates the name or location of their malicious documents to appear legitimate.
   - Use: This technique creates an authenticity illusion to bypass security measures.

5. **T1059.005 - Command and Scripting Interpreter: Visual Basic**
   - Description: Use of malicious Visual Basic scripts in phishing attachments.
   - Use: Executes the payload when the document is opened.

6. **T1091 - Replication Through Removable Media**
   - Description: Propagating malware via removable media.
   - Use: Spreads infections to disconnected networks.

7. **T1572 - Protocol Tunneling**
   - Description: Tunneling network communications to obfuscate C2 communications.
   - Use: Enhanced stealth during operations.

8. **T1102 - Web Service**
   - Description: Utilizing legitimate external web services for C2 communications.
   - Use: Reduces detection likelihood.

9. **T1090 - Proxy**
   - Description: Using tunneling methods to hide the host's IP address during HTTP GET requests.
   - Use: Maintains anonymity and evades filtering.

10. **T1568 - Dynamic Resolution**
    - Description: Frequent changes in DNS records to avoid blocking.
    - Use: Increases operational resilience.
