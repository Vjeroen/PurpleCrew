The curated list of attack techniques used by APT28 includes various tactics and methodologies employed during their cyber operations. Some of the notable techniques include:
1. **Spear Phishing**: Targeted email campaigns to trick users into providing sensitive information.
2. **Credential Dumping**: Extracting user credentials from applications or databases to gain unauthorized access.
3. **Command and Control (C2)**: Utilizing multiple domains and IPs for controlling compromised systems.
4. **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: Use of remote-access tools to maintain access to victim networks.
5. **Web Shells**: Uploading malicious scripts onto compromised web servers to execute commands remotely.
6. **Exploitation of Public-Facing Applications**: Taking advantage of vulnerabilities in external services to breach systems.
7. **Data Encrypted Transfer**: Encrypting data exfiltrated from networks to evade detection.
8. **Malicious Code Injection**: Inserting harmful scripts into legitimate applications.
9. **Network Sniffing**: Intercepting network traffic to gather sensitive information from protocols.
10. **Web-Based Attacks**: Employing cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks against web applications.

These techniques represent a combination of social engineering, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and maintaining persistence within target environments. APT28 routinely adapts its methods to avoid detection and to counteract defensive measures, continually evolving its attack strategies.
